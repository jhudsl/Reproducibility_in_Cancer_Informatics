This material was created by the ITCR Training Network (ITN) which is a collaborative effort of researchers around the United States to support cancer informatics and data science training through resources, technology, and events. This initiative is funded by the following grant: National Cancer Institute (NCI) UE5 CA254170. Our courses feature tools developed by ITCR Investigators and make it easier for principal investigators, scientists, and analysts to integrate cancer informatics into their workflows. Please see our website at www.itcrtraining.org for more information.

Cancer researchers may have analyzed data This course introduces the concepts of reproducibility and replicability in the context of cancer informatics. It uses hands-on exercises to demonstrate in practical terms how to increase the reproducibility of data analyses. The course also introduces tools relevant to reproducibility including analysis notebooks, Docker images, git and GitHub. 1.2 Target Audience The course is intended for students in the biomedical sciences and researchers who use informatics tools in their research. 1.3 Curriculum The course includes a hands-on exercises for how to apply reproducible code concepts to their code Individuals who take this course are encouraged to complete these activities as they follow along with the course material to help increase the reproducibility of their analyses. 1.4 Learning Objectives 1.5 Print out session info sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] knitr_1.33 magrittr_1.5 hms_0.5.3 R6_2.4.1 ## [5] rlang_0.4.10 highr_0.8 stringr_1.4.0 httr_1.4.2 ## [9] tools_4.0.2 xfun_0.26 jquerylib_0.1.1 htmltools_0.5.0 ## [13] ellipsis_0.3.1 yaml_2.2.1 leanbuild_0.1.2 digest_0.6.25 ## [17] tibble_3.0.3 lifecycle_1.0.0 crayon_1.3.4 bookdown_0.24 ## [21] readr_1.4.0 vctrs_0.3.4 fs_1.5.0 curl_4.3 ## [25] evaluate_0.14 rmarkdown_2.10 stringi_1.5.3 compiler_4.0.2 ## [29] pillar_1.4.6 pkgconfig_2.0.3 "],["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors These credits are based on our course contributors table guidelines.     Credits Names Pedagogy Lead Content Instructor(s) FirstName LastName Lecturer(s) (include chapter name/link in parentheses if only for specific chapters) -

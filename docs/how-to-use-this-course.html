<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> How to use this course</h1>
<p>To get the most out of this course, you should complete the exercises that come along with each chapter.</p>
<p>The exercises in each chapter have a set of example project files for you to practice applying the reproducibility concepts we discuss. We will walk through step-by-step how to transform these example project files into a nicely reproducible project that creates a nice heatmap!</p>
<p>These files come in Python or R options depending on your preference your resulting heatmap should resemble one of these:</p>
<p>This is the R version of the heatmap:
<img src="https://github.com/jhudsl/reproducible-r-example/raw/main/plots/aml_heatmap.png" alt="R Heatmap" /></p>
<p>This is the Python version of the heatmap:
<img src="https://github.com/jhudsl/reproducible-python-example/raw/main/plots/aml_heatmap.png" alt="Python Heatmap" /></p>
<p>We encourage you to apply the techniques and tools we use in the exercises to your own current and former projects that may exist on your computer!</p>
<div id="getting-comfortable-with-command-line" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Getting comfortable with command line</h2>
<p>We will have the download commands typed out for you that you will copy and paste to your command line.
If you are not comfortable with command line, or don’t know how to find it, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-guide-to-using-command-line-terminal-96815b97b955">read this article</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="software-requirements" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Software requirements</h2>
<p>For this course there are two software requirements you will need installed on your computer: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker">Docker</a>.
Both of these items are useful tools for creating reproducible analyses and will be helpful for you far beyond this course. We hope that our introduction to these tools will help you incorporate them into your daily work and development process.</p>
<p>Before we install them, let’s explain what git and Docker are and why they aid in reproducibility.</p>
<div id="why-docker" class="section level3" number="3.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Why Docker</h3>
<p>For this course, we will be working from a Docker image.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-using-the-examples_files/figure-html/1LMurysUhCjZb7DVF6KS9QmJ5NBjwWVjRn40MS9f2noE_gf9843bee50_0_5.png" title="Ruby has a particular computing environment she has developed her code from. This computing environment is represented as a bubble above her computer with various hexagons with version numbers as well as Rstudio and R installed on her computer.

Her code ran just fine on her particular computing environment. Avi attempted to run Ruby’s code on his very different local computing environment and got an error. His computer says ‘Error Version 4.2.1 of puRple required’" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve tried to run code you’ve obtained from a collaborator, or even code you developed a few months ago and obtained errors like what Avi is experiencing. Code often has software requirements in order for it to run (often called dependencies), and those dependencies have other dependencies they require and so on. Particular versions of software packages require particular versions of other software packages and this very easily becomes a tangled web of software that can feel impossible to untangle, such that it is colloquially known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>”.</p>
<p>In reality the computing environments are not as simple as shown with Ruby and Avi’s graphs above, they may become as nasty as this R inter-dependency graph shown here:</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-using-the-examples_files/figure-html/1LMurysUhCjZb7DVF6KS9QmJ5NBjwWVjRn40MS9f2noE_gf9843bee50_0_698.png" title="An visual example of how R packages are dependent on each other.

Image from https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/most-popular-r-packages-and-r-package-dependency-visualization/" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Not only is this a horrible headache to set up and detangle on your local computer, the software versions you use also influence reproducibility of your results! Even if Avi is able to run the analysis, he may not get the same result! This concept was illustrated by <span class="citation">BeaulieuJones2017 and Greene (<a href="#ref-BeaulieuJones2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. Using an example of identifying lists of differentially expressed genes, <span class="citation">BeaulieuJones2017 and Greene (<a href="#ref-BeaulieuJones2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> illustrate on the left (labeled A) how different software versions can influence the results of an analysis – rendering the analysis. But on the right (labeled B) they illustrate how using a container can make results reproducible, regardless of an individual’s operating system and local set up.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-using-the-examples_files/figure-html/1LMurysUhCjZb7DVF6KS9QmJ5NBjwWVjRn40MS9f2noE_gf9843bee50_0_704.png" title="From Beaulieu-Jones and Casey S. Greene, 2017 A.) The status quo requires a reader or reviewer to find and install specific versions of dependencies. These dependencies can become difficult to find and may become incompatible with newer versions of other software packages. Different versions of packages identify different numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes from the same source code and data. B.) Containers define a computing environment that captures dependencies. In container-based systems, the results are the same regardless of the host system." alt="From Beaulieu-Jones and Casey S.

Containers define a computing environment that captures dependencies. In container-based systems, the results are the same regardless of the host system." width="100%" /></p>
<p>What does container-ized approach mean?</p>
<p>If Ruby wants to ensure that Avi has the same set up for reproducing her results, she could mail her own physical computer to Avi, but clearly that’s not practical because she has other work to do. So instead, she can set up and run her analysis on a Docker container. With Docker she is able to send that container which contains the exact computing environment she used for her analysis, to Avi.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-using-the-examples_files/figure-html/1LMurysUhCjZb7DVF6KS9QmJ5NBjwWVjRn40MS9f2noE_gf9843bee50_0_391.png" title="Ruby has a particular computing environment she has developed her code from but this time Ruby has this computing environment wrapped up in a Docker container.

Avi the Associate is able to download the exact computing environment Ruby used for her analysis." width="100%" /></p>
<p>Now Avi can run the analysis knowing that he is using the exact same set up that Ruby did. He can avoid dependency hell and also has a better chance of reproducing the exact results Ruby did.</p>

<p>Using a container is a useful tool for reproducibility!</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1.1</span> Getting started with Docker</h4>
<p>We will introduce you to how to use a Docker container for this course, but first you will need to install Docker on your computer. After you are able to install Docker and git on your computer there will be no other software installations you will need to deal with for this course!</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Go here and install Docker</a>. Choose your operating system and follow along with their instructions.</p>
<p>You ideally should follow the prompts to create a Dockerhub account as well. Dockerhub is the online service that can store docker images.</p>

<div id="why-git" class="section level3" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Why git</h3>
<p>git is a version control system that is a great tool for creating reproducible analyses.
What is version control? Ruby here is experiencing a lack of version control and could probably benefit from using git.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-using-the-examples_files/figure-html/1LMurysUhCjZb7DVF6KS9QmJ5NBjwWVjRn40MS9f2noE_gf9843bee50_0_535.png" title="Ruby is looking at her computer with a lot of folders with different variations on similar names.

Ruby asks herself: Now was it “final_final_version_100%_up_to_date” or “final_version_edit5” that I was working from?" width="100%" /></p>
<p>All of us at one point or another have created different versions of a file or document, but for analysis projects this can easily get out of hand if you don’t have a system in place. That’s where git comes in handy.</p>
<p><strong>Version control systems like git allow you to:</strong></p>

<p>Excerpts from <a href="https://medium.com/@lanceharvieruntime/version-control-why-do-we-need-it-1681f4888cec">article</a> by <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Harvie2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Harvie2019?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Version control is a necessary tool for creating reproducible analyses. and to share the code easily, we often use GitHub, which is an online hosting service for git controlled files.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen to introduce you to git and GitHub because they are the most commonly used but the git terminology can take a bit getting used to, so we’ll start by introducing you to some terms that are often thrown around in the world of git.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Downloading the chapter files</h2>
<p>At the exercise portion of each chapter, we will prompt you to follow either the R or Python exercise. There is no need to do both, they are largely the same.
You will download either the R or Python project files and edit the files along with the course according to the prompts.</p>
<p>These example project files will be zipped up and you will need to unzip them before you can complete the exercise.</p>
<p>On most operating systems, you will be able to double click your chapter zip file to unzip, but for Windows you may have to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc">follow these instructions</a>). Please let us know with <a href="https://forms.gle/dLRHgo4Q5w15kCri9">the feedback form</a> if you encounter any problems along the way while completing the exercises.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> The Reproducibility checklist</h2>
<p>As you are proceeding through this course, you may want to apply some of these tools and techniques to your own analyses.
That is highly encouraged! Remember that analyses are not written perfectly on the first try (or the 2nd, or the nth, or ever!) but the more you are able to apply these principles to your analyses, the more future you (and perhaps your collaborators) will thank you for it!</p>
<p>We’ve created this checklist as a summarized guide of the course to help you of this course to help you evaluate in what areas your analyses could use a boost of reproducibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics/main/resources/reproducibility-checklist.md">Download the checklist</a></p>
<p>This checklist is written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">markdown format</a> – a short hand for html that can be rendered nicely like a webpage. You may want to store it with your analyses and perhaps on a GitHub repository (GitHub repositories are something we will walk through in the advanced course).</p>
<p>We hope you find this course useful and informative (and maybe even fun!).</p>

# How to use the example project files

Each chapter has a set of example project files for you to practice applying the reproducibility concepts we discuss.
These project files will start out as not very reproducible (they don't run properly) but at the end of the course your goal is to make them into a lovely project that creates a nice heatmap!

These files come in Python or R options depending on your preference your resulting heatmap should look like one of these:

This is the R version of the heatmap:
![R Heatmap](https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility-Examples/raw/main/r-examples/r-heatmap-final/plots/aml_heatmap.png)

This is the Python version of the heatmap:
![Python Heatmap](https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility-Examples/raw/main/python-examples/python-heatmap-final/plots/aml_heatmap.png)

## Downloading the chapter files

At the exercise portion of each chapter, we will prompt you to follow either the R or Python exercise. There is no need to do both, they are largely the same.
You will download either the R or Python project files and edit the files along with the course according to the prompts.

These example project files will be zipped up and you will need to unzip them before you can complete the exercise. 

On most operating systems, you will be able to double click your chapter zip file to unzip, but for Windows you may have to [follow these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc)). Please let us know with [the feedback form](https://forms.gle/dLRHgo4Q5w15kCri9) if you encounter any problems along the way while completing the exercises. 

We will have the download commands typed out for you that you will copy and paste to your command line but these are collapsed and "point and click" instructions are also provided where possible. If you are interested in using the command line but are not sure how to find it, [read this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-guide-to-using-command-line-terminal-96815b97b955). But if you are more comfortable with "point and click" by all means follow those instructions. 

We hope you find this course useful and informative (and maybe even fun!).

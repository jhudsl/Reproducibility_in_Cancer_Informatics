# How to use the example project files

Each chapter has a set of example project files for you to practice applying the reproducibility concepts we discuss.
These project files will start out as not very reproducible (they don't run properly) but at the end of the course your goal is to make them into a lovely project that creates a nice heatmap!

These files come in Python or R options depending on your preference your resulting heatmap should look like one of these:

This is the R version of the heatmap:
![R Heatmap](https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility-Examples/raw/main/r-examples/r-heatmap-final/plots/aml_heatmap.png)

This is the Python version of the heatmap:
![Python Heatmap](https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility-Examples/raw/main/python-examples/python-heatmap-final/plots/aml_heatmap.png)

At the beginning of each chapter, download either the R or Python project files and edit the files along with the course. 

Happy coding!

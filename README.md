## About this course

This course introduces the concepts of reproducibility and replicability in the context of cancer informatics.
It uses hands-on exercises to demonstrate in practical terms how to increase the reproducibility of data analyses.
The course also introduces tools relevant to reproducibility including analysis notebooks, Docker images, git and GitHub.

## Learning Objectives

This course will teach learners to:  

- Understand the fundamental concepts of reproducibility vs replicability
- Write a basic analysis that could be passed to another person/computer and be re-ran to obtain the same output
- Write analysis notebook that adheres to best practices for reproducibility and readability
- Create a reproducible project on GitHub that could be re-run by someone else
- Pull and use an existing Docker image for running an analysis
- Obtain confidence to learn and apply additional reproducibility tools to an analysis

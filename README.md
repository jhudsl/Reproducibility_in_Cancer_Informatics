## About this course

This course introduces the concepts of reproducibility and replicability in the context of cancer informatics.
It is the first course in a two part course on reproducibility (See the [advanced course here](https://github.com/jhudsl/Adv_Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics)).
It uses hands-on exercises to demonstrate in practical terms how to increase the reproducibility of data analyses.
The course also introduces tools relevant to reproducibility including analysis notebooks, package management, git and GitHub.

## Learning Objectives

This course will teach learners to:  

- Understand the fundamental concepts of reproducibility vs replicability
- Write a basic analysis that could be passed to another person/computer and be re-ran to obtain the same output
- Write analysis notebook that adheres to best practices for reproducibility and readability
- Create a reproducible project on GitHub that could be re-run by someone else

## About the chapter example files

Each chapter has its own zip file to be downloaded as a learner is going through a particular chapter.

There are the Python and R versions.
For example, for chapter 4 there are:
```
python-examples/python-heatmap-chapt-4
r-examples/r-heatmap-chapt-4
```
These files are zipped up by a GitHub action so they are ready for easy downloading by the learner.
The user will download these according to the chapter and follow along with the chapter to make them more reproducible and eventually hopefully have something that looks like the "final" reproducible example versions.

This is the URL pattern they can find the chapter files at:

_For Python_:
```
https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics/raw/main/chapter-zips/python-heatmap-chapt-4.zip
```
_For R_:
```
https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics/raw/main/chapter-zips/r-heatmap-chapt-4.zip
```

## Obtaining the "final" versions of the example reproducible analyses

Both the "final" versions of the example analyses have their own repositories that are submodules of this one (located in their respective directories with the less reproducible versions of them in the `r-examples` and `python-examples` directories).
_Final_ here is in quotes because we may continue to make improvements to this notebook too -- this course tries to emphasize that work on data analyses should be iterative and we never have to say we're done with an analysis if we find other ways it can be improved!

## Running the R docker image:

With your current directory being the top of this repository, you can do:
```
cd r-examples/reproducible-r-example
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile . -t jhudsl/reproducible-r
docker run -it -v $PWD:/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=password -p 8787:8787 jhudsl/reproducible-r
```
Then, in the browser of your choice, navigate to localhost:8787 ; using `rstudio` as your username and `password` as your password (or whatever you choose for your password in the command above). This docker image has the `renv` included in it.

### Running the Python docker image:

With your current directory being the top of this repository, you can do:
```
cd python-examples/reproducible-python-example
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile . -t jhudsl/reproducible-python
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -p 8888:8888 jhudsl/reproducible-python
```
Then, in the browser of your choice, navigate to the port that the output tells you. This docker image will automatically have your conda environment set up and working.

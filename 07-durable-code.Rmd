## General principles

#### Work on your code iteratively
<img src="resources/images/iterative.png" width="12%">

Getting your code to work the first time is the first step, but don't stop there! 
Just like in writing a manuscript you wouldn't consider your first draft a final draft, your polishing code works best in an iterative manner. Although you may need to set it aside for the day to give your brain a rest, return to your code later with fresh eyes and try to look for ways to improve upon it! 

#### Prioritize readability over cleverness 
<img src="resources/images/readable.png" width="12%">

Some cleverness in code can be helpful, too much can make it difficult for others to understand. If cleverness comprises the readability of your code, it probably is not worth it. Clever but unreadable code won't be re-used or trusted by others (including perhaps your future self!).

#### DRY up your code
<img src="resources/images/DRY.png" width="12%">

[DRY](https://web.archive.org/web/20131204221336/http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself) is an acronym: "Don't repeat yourself".

> "I hate code, and I want as little of it as possible in our product." 

– @Diederich2012

If you find yourself writing something more than once, you might want to write a function, or store something as a variable. The added benefit of writing a function is you might be able to borrow it in another project. DRY code is easier to fix and maintain because if it breaks, its easier to fix something in one place, then in 10 places.  

DRY code is easier on the reviewer because they don't have to review the same thing twice, but also because they don't have to review the same thing twice. ;)
DRYing code is something that takes some iterative passes and edits through your code, but in the end DRY code saves you and your collaborators time and can be something you reuse again in a future project!

#### Don't be afraid to delete and refresh  
<img src="resources/images/delete.png" width="12%">

Don’t be afraid to delete it all and re-run (multiple times). Keeping around old code is generally more of a hindrance than a time saver. Sometimes it can be easy to get very attached to a chunk of code that took you a long time to troubleshoot but there are three reasons you don't need to stress about deleting it:  

1) You might write better code on the second try (or third or nth). 
2) Keeping around old code makes it harder for you to write and troubleshoot new better code -- it's easier to confuse yourself. Sometimes a fresh start can be what you need. 
3) With version control you can always return to that old code! 

This means you should not comment out old code. Just delete it! No code is so precious that you need to keep it commented out (particularly if you are using version control and you can retrieve it in other ways should you need it). 

Related to this, if you want to be certain that your code is reproducible, it's worth deleting all your output, and re-running everything with a fresh session. The first step to knowing if your analysis is reproducible is seeing if you can repeat it yourself!

#### Use code comments effectively  
<img src="resources/images/comment.png" width="12%">

Good code comments are a part of writing good, readable code! Your code is more likely to stand the test of time for longer if others, including yourself in the future, can see what’s happening enough to trust it themselves. This will encourage others to use your code and help you maintain it!

'Current You' who is writing your code may know what is happening but 'Future You' will have no idea what 'Current You' was thinking [@Spielman]:

> 'Future You' comes into existence about one second after you write code, and has no idea what on earth Past You was thinking. Help out 'Future You' by adding lots of comments! 'Future You' next week thinks Today You is an idiot, and the only way you can convince 'Future You' that Today You is reasonably competent is by adding comments in your code explaining why Today You is actually not so bad.

Your code and your understanding of it will fade soon after you write it, leaving your hard work to deprecate. Code that works is a start, but **readable** AND working code is best!

Comments can help clarify at points where your code might need further explanation. The act of writing them can also help you think out your thought process and perhaps identify a better solution to the odd parts of your code.

#### Use informative variable names
<img src="resources/images/variable-name.png" width="12%">

Try to avoid using variable names that have no meaning like `tmp` or `x`, or `i`. Meaningful variable names make your code more readable! Additionally, variable names that are longer than one letter are much easier to search and replace if needed. One letter variables are hard to replace and hard to read.

> 1 Write Intention-Revealing Names. 
> 2 Use Consistent Notation for Naming Convention. 
> 3 Use Standard Terms. 
> 4 Do Not Number Variable Name. 
> 5 When you find another way to name variable, Refactor as fast as possible.

#### 7. Follow a code style 
<img src="resources/images/style.png" width="12%">

Just like when writing doesN"t FoLLOW conv3nTi0Ns OR_sPAcinng 0r sp3llinG, it can be distracting, the same goes for code. Your code may even work all the same, just like you understood what I wrote in that last sentence, but a lack of consistent style can make require more brain power from your readers for them to understand. For reproducibility purposes, readability is important! The easier you can make it on your readers, the more likely they will be able to understand and reproduce the results. 

There are different style guides out there that people adhere to. It doesn't matter so much which one you choose, so much that you pick one and stick to it for a particular project.  

_Python style guides_: 

- [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) @PEP8. 
- [Google Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) @GooglePython.

_R style guides_: 

- [Hadley Wickham's Style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) @Wickham.
- [Google R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) @GoogleR.

Although writing code following a style as you are writing is a good practice, we're all human and that can be tricky to do, so we recommend using an automatic styler on your code to fix up your code for you. 
For Python code, you can use [python black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and for R, [styler](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/). 


#### Set the seed if your analysis has randomness involved
<img src="resources/images/seeds.png" width="12%">

If any randomness is involved in your analysis, you will want to set the seed in order for your results to be reproducible. 

In brief, computers don't actually create numbers randomly they create [numbers pseudorandomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator). But if you want your results to be reproducible, you should give your computer a seed by which to create random numbers. This will allow anyone who re-runs your analysis to have a positive control and eliminate randomness as a reason the results were not reproducible. 

<details> <summary> For more on how setting the seed works -- a quick experiment </summary>
To illustrate how seeds work, run we'll run a quick experiment with setting the seed here: 

First let's set a seed (it doesn't matter what number we use, just that we pick a number), so let's use `1234` and then create a "random" number. 

```{r}
# Set the seed:
set.seed(1234)

# Now create a random number again
runif(1)
```

Now if we try a different seed, we will get a different "random" number. 

```{r}
# Set a different seed:
set.seed(4321)

# Now create a random number again
runif(1)
```

But, if we return to the original seed we used, `1234`, we will get the original "random" number we got.  

```{r}
# Set this back to the original seed
set.seed(1234)

# Now we'll get the same "random" number we got when we set the seed to 1234 previously
runif(1)
```

## Exercise: Make code more durable!

<details> <summary>Python version of the exercise</summary>


1. Start up JuptyerLab with running `juptyer lab` from your command line.
2. Activate your conda environment using `conda activate reproducible-python`. 
3. Open up your notebook you made in the previous chapter `make-heatmap.ipynb`
4. Now we'll work on applying the principles from this chapter to the code.





</details>

<details> <summary>R version of the exercise</summary>


1. Open up RStudio.
2. Open up the notebook you created in the previous chapter.  
3. Now we'll work on applying the principles from this chapter to the code. We'll cover some of the key points here, but then we encourage you to dig into the fully transformed notebook we will link at the end of this section. 

**Get rid of setwd**

_Rationale:_  
`setwd()` almost never work for anyone besides the one person who wrote it. And in a few days/weeks it may not work for them either.  

_Before:_  
```
setwd("Super specific/filepath/that/noone/else/has/")
```
_After:_  
Now that we are working from a notebook, we know that the default [current directory is wherever the notebook is placed!](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/working-directory.html)

_Related readings:_ [Jenny Bryan will light your computer on fire if you use setwd](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

**Give the variables more informative names**

`xx` doesn't tell us what is in the data here. Also by using the `readr::read_tsv()` from tidyverse we'll get a cleaner, faster read and won't have to specify `sep` argument. Note we are also fixing some spacing and using `<-` so that we can stick to readability conventions. 

_Before:_  
```
xx=read.csv("metadata_SRP070849.tsv", sep = "\t")
```
_After:_  
```
metadata <- readr::read_tsv("metadata_SRP070849.tsv")
```

4. Run your notebook through `styler`. First you'll need to install it and add it to your `renv`.
```
install.packages("styler")
```
Then add it to your `renv` by running: 
```
renv::snapshot()
```
Now you can automatically style your code by running this command from your Console (be sure to replace the `"make-heatmap.Rmd"` with whatever you have named your notebook:   
```
styler::style_file("make-heatmap.Rmd")
```
